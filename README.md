# Dog_Project
This is a project to learn about CNNs by creating an algorithm which classifies user-provided images of dogs and humans into dog breeds.

# Installations

The code was written using python 3. Any necessary libraries beyond the standard Anaconda extension are being installed as part of the code.

# Project Motivation

This project was completed as the final project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, and a lot of the methods used are heavily influenced by that degree and the guidance provided.
CNNs have a lot of application in reality already and can make a real difference in areas such as cancer detection. Learning how they work and how to apply them is something I have wanted to do for a long time and this guided project is the perfect opportunity.

# File Descriptions

Besides this README file, the repository contains a Notebook which contains all the code for this project including the guidance, and a Report detailing the process of this project.

# License, Acknowledgements, and Authors

As can be seen from the notebook, guidance and code examples were given throughout the notebook. The authors of the raw file for the project are @cgearhart @luisguiserran.
Acknowledgement also goes to Aurelien Geron, whose 2019 book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow I consulted multiple times for this project.
